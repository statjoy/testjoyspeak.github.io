#### Optimizing a Car-Sharing Fleet

I'm so proud of this paper since it will be the first and only academic paper I'll ever publish - and it even won an award! We developed a network flow model to optimize where cars should be located, featuring a case study of Boston Zipcar data. Code was written in Python, using Gurobi optimization libraries.

#### The OptiPower Game 

University of Michigan hosts a number of engineering events for high schoolers each year, and we developed this game to teach concepts about power/energy optimization. We had a lot of fun making a bunch of funky-colored macros in Microsoft Excel (old-school!) and we eventually presented the game at the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE).
